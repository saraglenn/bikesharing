# Bike Trip Analysis 

## Overview 

Tableau Public was used to create visualizations to show:

•	the length of time bikes are are checked out, then filtered by gender

•	the number of trips for riders and a breakdown of genders for each hour of each day of the week

•	the number of trips for each user a breakdown of genders for each day of the week

The Citi Bike System Data was downloaded from https://citibikenyc.com/system-data

Pandas was used to change the datatype of the tripduration oclum from an integer to a datetimes datatype, then exported as a csv. Tableau was then used to create the visualizations. 

## Conversion and DataFrame Creation

The data was manipulated in Jupyter Notebook to create a converted bikesharing dataframe.
